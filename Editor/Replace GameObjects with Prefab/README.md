# Replace GameObjects with Prefab

*v1; last update: 2020-07-09*

An editor extension that let's you replace a set of selected GameObjects with a prefab. Can be opened from the menu under *Tools/Replace With Prefab*.

The code is loosely based on the [script by Jason Weimann](https://unity3d.college/2017/09/07/replace-gameobjects-or-prefabs-with-another-prefab/).
